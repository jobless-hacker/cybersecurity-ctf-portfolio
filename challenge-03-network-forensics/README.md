# Challenge 3: Network Traffic Analysis - Malicious Communication Detection

## Overview
This challenge simulates the analysis of network traffic from a compromised corporate environment. You must identify the attack vector, trace the attacker's activities, and extract indicators of compromise.

## Scenario
A corporate workstation has been compromised through a phishing email. The attacker has established persistence, performed lateral movement, and exfiltrated sensitive data. Your task is to analyze the network traffic to reconstruct the complete attack timeline.

## Attack Timeline Reconstruction

### Phase 1: Initial Compromise (09:15 - 09:20)
1. **Phishing Email Delivery** - Malicious email with attachment arrives
2. **User Interaction** - Employee clicks on malicious link
3. **Credential Harvesting** - Initial data collection from victim
4. **Malware Download** - 2.4MB payload retrieved via HTTP

### Phase 2: Command & Control Establishment (09:20 - 09:30)  
1. **Reverse Shell** - Connection established to attacker C2 on port 4444
2. **System Reconnaissance** - Automated discovery commands executed
3. **Persistence Setup** - Backdoor mechanisms installed
4. **Environment Mapping** - Network topology discovery

### Phase 3: Lateral Movement Attempts (09:30 - 09:35)
1. **Credential Extraction** - Local password harvesting
2. **Network Scanning** - Internal system discovery
3. **Domain Controller Access** - Administrative share enumeration
4. **Privilege Escalation** - Attempt to gain domain admin rights

### Phase 4: Data Exfiltration (09:35 - 09:45)
1. **Data Discovery** - Sensitive file identification
2. **Data Staging** - File compression and preparation
3. **Encrypted Transfer** - 15.7MB uploaded via HTTPS
4. **Credential Dumping** - Passwords uploaded to paste service

## Advanced Analysis Techniques

### 1. Statistical Analysis
```
# Connection frequency analysis
connections_per_minute = analyze_connection_patterns(pcap_data)

# Data volume analysis
transfer_sizes = extract_transfer_volumes(pcap_data)
detect_exfiltration_patterns(transfer_sizes)
```

### 2. Behavioral Profiling
```
# User activity patterns
normal_patterns = baseline_user_behavior(historical_data)
anomalies = detect_behavioral_deviations(current_data, normal_patterns)

# Network flow analysis
flow_patterns = analyze_network_flows(pcap_data)
suspicious_flows = identify_unusual_patterns(flow_patterns)
```

### 3. Machine Learning Integration
```
# Anomaly detection using ML
ml_model = load_network_anomaly_model()
predictions = ml_model.predict(network_features)
high_risk_connections = filter_high_risk(predictions)
```
